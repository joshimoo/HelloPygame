# Hello Pygame
spent the weekend learning python and pygame  
by working through the book [making games with python & pygame](https://inventwithpython.com/pygame/)  

after finishing the book I continued reading additional sources on pythons oop constructs, generators, etc  
then I went and created my own [minesweeper clone](minesweeper/)  

if you are an experienced developer and just looking for a quick python overview have a look at  
[learn x in y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/)  


## Mine Sweeper
- OOP Class Design
- using Bit Masking to encode cell states
- nice flood fill algorithm
